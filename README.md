# Builing
In this project, we propose developing Building, a web-based platform that enables users to post and find reviews from experience of living in specific neighborhoods. This allows users to get advice from the community to find a right fit when looking to move. This will allow the users to see rankings on school districts, walkability, average age, safety, activities, landlords, and whatever the community would like to share. This will be set as a map with reviews pinned based off location as well as local activities. This platform will also allow an opportunity for users moving to a new area to be able to reach out and meet members of the community. The goal and what makes this project different is to have members of the community give genuine reports as well as information of the area. <img width="468" height="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bce7cd9d-4296-4e23-ae23-37a86a4883ae" />
