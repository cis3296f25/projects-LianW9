# Building
In this project, we propose developing Building, a web-based platform that enables users to post and find reviews from experience of living in specific neighborhoods. This allows users to get advice from the community to find a right fit when looking to move. This will allow the users to see rankings on school districts, walkability, average age, safety, activities, landlords, and whatever the community would like to share. This will be set as a map with reviews pinned based off location as well as local activities. This platform will also allow an opportunity for users moving to a new area to be able to reach out and meet members of the community. The goal and what makes this project different is to have members of the community give genuine reports as well as information of the area.
  
# Conceptual Design
Hardware and software architecture
-	Client – runs on users’ device, user interface for maps, reviews, posting, and messaging, communicates with backend through APIs
-	Server – used on cloud-based Linux server, connects to the database, cache, search engine, and external APIs
Operating system
-	macOs or Windows for development
-	Linux running in cloud infrastructure for production
-	Any web browser for client environment 
Programming Languages
-	JavaScript
-	SQL
Framework 
-	React.js - front end, JavaScript that helps build an interactive user interface
-	Express.js - back end, JavaScript (Node.js), handles routes and connects to data base
Libraries
-	Front end - Tailwind CSS, Axios, Map box
-	Back end – Sequelize, Passport.js, Socket.IO
APIs and external services	
-	Map API – google maps platform
-	Authentication providers
-	Storage
-	Notification APIs
-	Security

# Background
There are other websites where one shows a map with information on each area, another cite that shows reviews of verified users, and another that would make a group chat but there is no website with all of that in one place. The goal of this project is to have the website open up with the option to be someone who is looking or someone who is living, if they are living in the area then they are brough to a page similar to https://nextdoor.com/, but if they are looking they will be brought to a map first and then can explore other people’s posts.

-Unzip file on your computer 
- open index.html on your browser
Operating system – macOS
Compiler – not required because it is a front-end web application.

# Required Resources
To develop this project, we would need front-end web development, map APIs, databases (SQL) for storing reviews, and webhosting. The only hardware necessary would-be standard laptops or desktops and potentially server hardware. As far as software resources this project would require VS Code, Git and GitHub, libraries, and hosting services. These all seem within the standard Computer Science Department lab resources.
